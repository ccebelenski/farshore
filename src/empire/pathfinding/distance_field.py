"""`PassabilityGrid` + `DistanceField`: all-targets distances from one flood.

`Pathfinder.find_path` answers one (start, goal) question per call; AI
scoring loops ask many goals about the same start (every army scores every
objective). For a uniform-cost profile, one breadth-first flood from the
unit answers *all* of its objectives — these classes compute that flood once
per unit, so a scoring loop pays O(cells) per unit instead of O(search) per
(unit, target).

Exactness contract (relied on by `BaselineTactical` and verified in
`tests/empire/pathfinding/test_distance_field.py`): for a uniform-cost
profile and any `goal != origin`, `DistanceField(origin, ...).steps_to(goal)`
equals `Pathfinder.find_path(origin, goal, ...).steps`, and is `None` exactly
when `find_path` returns `None`. The flood mirrors `find_path`'s passability
rules: the origin itself need not be passable (`find_path` never checks its
start), every *entered* cell must be — including the goal — out-of-bounds
cells are never entered, and unseen cells (when a `view` is given) are
passable iff `profile.unknown_cost` is not `None`.

`path_to` reconstructs a shortest path by descending the field. Its route is
*a* minimum-step path with deterministic (Direction-enum-order) tie-breaks —
not necessarily the same cells `find_path`'s heap order would pick. Length
and reachability are identical; only equal-length route choice may differ.
